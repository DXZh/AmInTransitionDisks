# Summary

The key point of this study is that we provide a collection of disks in which MHD wind seems to be the only plausible mechanism to drive accretion. The evidence is that the required viscous alpha will be larger than 1 to explain the accretion rate observed in the PPDs, which is unphysical.

Then we goes on to check the ionization structure by calculating the ionization structure and report the Am distribution. We find that generally speaking, the ionizaiton condition is consistent with that required by wind-driven scenario (not too high so that the B-field will be dragged by the accretion flow). This is not straight forward as TD has lower surface density and people may expect higher ionzation fraction and better coupling between gas and B-field. However, as Am is proportional to the number density of ions, in the cavity of TD, although ionization fraction is higher, the overall gas density is lower. This results in a relatively low (low enough to prevent B-field been dragged towards the central star) Am, allowing constant wind solution.

## Proper Am for the wind solution

I'm not quite sure.. According to Wang & Goodman 2017, Wardle & Konigl 1993's wind solution requires Am~O(1). However, Am can be <<1 according to Xuening's simulation. So for me, the only requirement for wind solution to be valid is that Am should not be too high, so that B-field won't be quickly dragged to the host star.

So namely, I choose Am<10 to be the criterion that "ionization condition allows constant wind solution".

## Summary of the calculation results

We calculate for 16 disks which X-ray flux is reported in literature. And the short summary is: Am never reaches 10 in all the cavities. Sometimes it goes above 10 when z>3H outside the cavity.

## Understand the results (unfinished)

In this section, we try to investigate why Am didn't increase dramatically in the cavity. (which is contrary to Wang & Goodman 2017's results, see Fig2 model4, Am is always>100 in their model.)

Let's do this by comparing the ionization in TW Hya (Strong X-ray, low surface density) and GM Aur (Strong X-ray, full disk).
